In the deployment, pickle_db has been corrupted
The file has this contnt
<code>
    I100
    .
</code>

emptying the file didnt work.
replacing it with local pickle_db worked

It might because of the onetime server crash. 

-----

This not only lost all data it also broke the working 
----

Both the issues try to reproduce and fix.
1st issue can be reproduced by rebooting the server and see if it happens. see the node_pickle code if the file is kept open all the time or file closing is not done properly
2nd issue reproduce in local by using that corrupted pickle_db file
--------------

save pickle db in cloud or atleast take copy every 5 mins. some mechanism for it to run incase of pickle_db corruption
